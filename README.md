# swirl_templates
This is an attempt to add consistant randomization to the testing criteria in swiRl.

Since that was a tad unclear and a bit of an oxymoron, the less sound-bytey description is that these functions are designed to find integer tokens within course files, and replace them with random integers within a provided range.  It will keep the same random integers throughout the entire course, and create new ones every time the course is loaded.

These functions are created for an independent study course at Eastern Connecticut State University.  They are created under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, meaning they are free to use and modify or do whatever you want with them, so long as credit is given where due.  Oh, and as a personal note, I would appriciate if you would wait to do all that until the project is finished, which as of today (10/19/2015), it is not.  This readme will be updated when it is.
